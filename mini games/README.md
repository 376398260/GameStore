# Note

Games in this folder are built on a simple browser-based graphic user interface module `simplegui`. To play, simply copy and paste code into [codeskulptor](http://www.codeskulptor.org/) and hit run. Note that things might behave a bit different in browsers other than chrome. At this point, all of the code is written in Python 2.7, so please use the python 2 version of codeskulptor.

Please refer to the codeskulptor official docs on "Graphic modules" - simplegui at:  
http://www.codeskulptor.org/docs.html#tabs-Python  

It's also possible to run event-driven python games locally by using GUI packages such as `SimpleGUICS2Pygame`, `PyOPENGL` and `tk2`. `OPENGL` supports building 3D interactive games, and `SimpleGUICS2Pygame` allows us to run programs in the console with extra options.
